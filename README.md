## Introduction
This is Brown University LEMS lab internal collaborative research project which aims to reconstruct surfaces from a set of 3D curves and multiple 2D images. Basically, it is a a hypothesis and verification framework, where many hypothesized surfaces are constructed from pairs of 3D curves, and are subsequently verified via projecting to multiview images to seek supports from detected 2D [third-order edges](https://github.com/C-H-Chien/Third-Order-Edge-Detector). This work has been proposed by the papers listed in references, but the source code is missing. Here, we *(i)* surrect its experiments, *(ii)* optimize the pipeline to make it super efficient, and *(iii)* run on a modern synthetic dataset, *i.e.*, [ABC dataset](https://deep-geometry.github.io/abc-dataset/) with rendered multiviews from [NEF](https://github.com/yunfan1202/NEF_code), enabling us to easy debug the entire process. <br />

## How to run for obj 00000325
- Download ABC_curves_result, ABC_NEF_obj and ABE-NEF folders [sample data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gYFKFiUe2GCFWLKpOgJ_s1Fn8xTjoQqE/view?usp=drive_link)
- After cloning the repo, create a folder called data.
- Build the following file heiracy usnig the data from the data folders downloaded previously:
- data/
└── object_00000325/
	├── images/           (00.jpg ... 49.jpg)   (take the images from the traini_img folder)
	├── edges/            (00.mat ... 49.mat with TO_edges) (folder with all the edges)
	├── 00.projmatrix ... 49.projmatrix
	└── curve_graph_00000325.mat     this file will be made in the following steps
  └──any other files relating to object 325 within the downloaded folders
- Creating curve_graph_00000325.mat:
    Open get_ABC_NEF_gt_curve_points.py and change , at arounf line 90 the root_dir and base_dir accordingly:
      root_dir = r"{your path}\Surface_by_Lofting_From_3D_Curves\tools"
      base_dir = r"{your path}\ABC_NEF_obj"
      Near line 100 set desired_obj = "00000325".
      Replace the line plt.axis([range_size[0],range_size[1],range_size[0],range_size[1]])
        with the two lines : ax.set_xlim(range_size[0], range_size[1])
                              ax.set_ylim(range_size[0], range_size[1])
    Open main.m and update the fol;lowing lines:
        media_storage = ""; dataset_name = ""; dataset_path = ""; object_tag = "00000325"; save_curve_mat_file = 1;
        ymlPath = fullfile("{your path}\Surface_by_Lofting_From_3D_Curves\data","00000325_3062bccff48e47a2b9de05e3_features_020.yml"); [!!Ensure you have the necessary .ymlfile]
        at the bottom update this line:
                complete_curve_graph = final_curves;
                save(fullfile("{your path}\Surface_by_Lofting_From_3D_Curves\data", "curve_graph_00000325.mat"), "complete_curve_graph");
    Open Matlab and cd into Surface_by_Lofting_From_3D_Curves and run "tools/curve_sampling/main" OR download Matlab extension on VScode and press the run triangle button at the top while main.m is open

- PATH changes
      Occlusion_consistency_check: within lines 30-55 replace all 4 instances of "Amsterdam" data with the following lines:
            fname1 = fullfile(pwd, 'data','object_00000325', sprintf("%02d.projmatrix", view-1));                  for projection matrices
                    NOTE: there are 2 lines on projection Matrices, replace both
            fname2 = fullfile(pwd, 'data', 'object_00000325', 'images', 'edges', sprintf("%02d.mat", view-1));     for edges
            fname3 = fullfile(pwd, 'data', 'object_00000325', 'images', sprintf( "%02d.png", view-1));             change to png as data is png not jpeg
      PreProcessed_3D_Curves_main: update the line: input_curves = load(fullfile(pwd, 'data', 'curve_graph_00000325.mat')).complete_curve_graph;
-In matlab run main.m. curve_graph_00000325.mat  should be made now!
-In order to prevent errors from proximity pairing and lofting when attempting to run the repository make the following changes:
            in PreProcessed_3D_Curves_main : PARAMS.TAU_NUM_OF_PTS = 50;
            in PreProcessed_3D_Curves_main : PARAMS.BREAK = 0;
            in proximity_pairing : PARAMS.TAU_ALPHA = [5 150];
-In Matlab cd to Surface_by_Lofting_From_3D_Curves and type run in the command window
-Ensure blender\output in Surface_by_Lofting_From_3D_Curves has the .ply files
-Open blender and import these standford ply files to view
